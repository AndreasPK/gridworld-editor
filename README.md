# Gridworld DNA Editor

A simple tool to edit creature DNA for gridworld.

WARNING: This is partially vibe coded and the quality is accordingly.

## How can I use this?

* In gridworld export a creature of choice:
  + Microscope ->
  + place creature under export/import (at the bottom) ->
  + export under some name
* Start the dna editor
* File -> Open
* At the point of writing by default the exported creature DNA will be at:
  C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Gridworld\app\data\Creatures\Exported\DNA

Now can you can play around with it. Try navigating to one of the DNA entries of your creature in
the side bar.

If you use File->Save the creature data will be overwritten.
You can also save it under a new name.

There is no undo function so consider making a backup of your creature first!

## Editing things:

If you select a cell from some DNA layer by navigating in the sidebar on the right side
details about the current DNA layer will be displayed.

In the top there is a grid of all the cells in the DNA.
In the bottom there are the properties of this cell if created.

If you mouse over the value of one of the properties you can change it by using
your mouse wheel. Cell type is just a gene property! And can also be edited by
the mouseover.

If you mouse over an empty cell in the grid (represented by _) and double click
you can add a new cell to the DNA. If you hit DELETE while a cell is selected
the cell will be ... deleted.

## Importing

As long as you save the create in the same folder it should just import.
